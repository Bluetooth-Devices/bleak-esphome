"""
High-level example: connect to a BLE device through a proxy and read GATT.

``setup_scanner.py`` shows how to bring an ``APIConnectionManager`` up and let
``bleak`` *discover* advertisements. This example takes the next step — the one
the whole library exists for — and opens a *GATT connection* to a specific
device, routed transparently through whichever proxy can reach it.

``bleak_esphome`` never appears in the connect/read code: once a scanner is
registered, ``habluetooth`` routes a plain ``bleak.BleakClient`` to the right
proxy. Replace ``ESPHOME_DEVICES`` and ``TARGET_ADDRESS`` with your hardware
before running. This talks to real hardware, so it cannot run in CI.

Proxy caveats worth knowing (see ``docs/usage.md`` for the full list):

* A device is connectable only if a proxy advertising ``ACTIVE_CONNECTIONS``
  heard it. Scan-only proxies surface advertisements but cannot open a link.
* Connection slots are finite. ``connect()`` waits for a free slot and raises
  ``TimeoutError`` if none frees within the timeout — so disconnect when done
  (the ``async with`` block below does this for you).
